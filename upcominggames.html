  <h2> Vampire - The Masquerade: Swansong </h2>
  <p> Vampire - The Masquerade: Swansong is set to release on the 19th of May 2022, and is the tenth game in a long line of Vampire - The Masquerade games. Based on a table-Top
    roleplaying game, Swansong follows on from Bloodhunt, and will be released on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It was developed by a new developer who has
    not developed any previous Vampire - The Masquerade games before, and is therefore new to the series. We'll soon see what fans of the series think when this new installment is
    released. </p>

  <h2> MADiSON </h2>
  <p> MADiSON is set to release on the 24th of June 2022. MADiSON is a first person psychological horror game where you must use a camera to connect the human world and what ever is
    beyond it, you must use it to survive. With a newcoming development team, BLOODIOUS Games, fans of horror games hope that they will bring something new and refreshing to the

  <h2> Saints Row </h2>
  <p> The Saints Row Reboot is set to release on the 23rd of August 2022 and follows a similar style to that of the previous games. With lewd language and humourous props, fans love
    what Saints Row has to offer. Saints Row is an action-adventure shooter game and the player must use their gang to gain control of the all the districts of their city, similarly to previous
    installments in the franchise. Saints Row is set to release on Playstation and Xbox, and has been developed by Volition who developed the rest of the franchise. I'm sure fans are
    gonna have fun with this one. </p>

  <h2> Forspoken </h2>
  <p> Forspoken is set to release on the 11th of October 2022. Forspoken is an action-roleplaying game which follows Frey Holland who is transported in to a magical, fantasy realm
    and must use her new powers to get back home. The game comes from Luminous Productions who helped create Final Fantasy XV although it is their debut title. It is set to release
    on PS5 as an exclusive for two years. I'm sure fans of fantasy games will be lining up to buy this judging by it's stunning visuals and intriguing gameplay. </p>

  <h2> Starfield </h2>
  <p> Starfield is an upcoming action role-playing game set in space, set to release on the 11th of Novemeber 2022. Developed by Bethesda studios, it is a new turn for them as they
    usually do fantasy games. Despite the fact that fans of the Elder Scrolls have been begging for a new installment, Bethesda have decided to develop Starfield. This new direction
    may prove to be good for them as it is their first new intellectual property in over 25 years. However, unfortunately for Playstation users, the game is set to be released on the
    Xbox and PC. We'll see in time what fans of the Elder Scrolls think of Starfield. </p>

  <h2> Stray </h2>
  <p> Stray is an upcoming adventure game where you get to play as cat as he explores a world populated by robots and machines, whilst he sets out to return to his family. It is being
    developed by BlueTwelve Studio as their debut game. No official release date has been given but the trailer did tease 'Early 2022' and as we are nearing the middle of 2022, it's looking
    more and more like it's been delayed, which is a shame, but I think a good game is better than a broken game. I myself, am super excited for this release as it's not everyday that you
    get to play as a cat in a video game, and I am super excited to see what this game brings us. Stray is set to release on PC, PS4 and PS5. </p>
