<h1> About The Gamer </h1>
<div id="main" class="div-main">
<p> Hi, my names Lea_Plays, my real name is Leanne though. As you can guess by the sight I like to play video games, it has been a passion of mine since I was very young, and growing
  up watching my older sister play them. My first video game though, was Pokemon Diamond on the Nintendo DS. I loved that game, I started with the Nintendo DS, then moved onto the
  Wii. Then when I was 11, I got my Xbox 360 where my first game was Skyrim which has since been my favourite game of all time (don't agree with the constant re-releasing of it though).
  I have since bought a PS4, Xbox One, a Nintendo Switch and my very own gaming PC, well two technically. PC gaming has since become one of my favourite past-times and I often game With
  my sister and my friends which is always such good fun. </p>

  <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
    <p> I have three cats: Jimin, Willow and Wispa. </p>
    <p> I own a 1991 Mazda Mx-5, it has pop-up headlights and it is my first car </p>
    <p> I am currently studying Media Production at DMU. </p>
    <p> I have an older sister who I often play games with, and who does youtube.</p>
